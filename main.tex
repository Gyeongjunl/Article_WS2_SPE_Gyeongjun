Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in solid-state materials enable scalable quantum communication and information processing. In two-dimensional semiconductors, however, controlled generation of optically active point defects remains challenging. Here, we use \textit{in situ} high-temperature annealing of hBN-encapsulated monolayer \ce{WS2} on a suspended micro-heater to produce a localized exciton emitter. Annealing around 1100 K leads to the emergence of an utlra-sharp emission line, $X_\mathrm{L}$, located around 80 meV below the neutral exciton. $X_\mathrm{L}$ displays a resolution-limited linewidth at 0.2 meV, a radiative lifetime of $\sim$0.9 ns. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy shows that $X_\mathrm{L}$ originates from intrinsic excitons trapped at vacancy-like defects generated during annealing. Photon correlation measurments $g^2(\tau)$ shows clear antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0)\approx 0.4$, proving single quantum emitter. This approach provides a controlled and robust pathway for engineering SPEs in monolayer \ce{WS2} and highlights the potential of defect-based quantum light sources in 2D semiconductors.

\section{Introduction}

Since the discovery of graphene \cite{novoselov-2004}, research on atomically thin materials has accelerated, particularly for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as \ce{MoS2}, \ce{WS2}, and \ce{WSe2} thanks  to the isolation of atomically thin semiconductors based on TMDs, such as \ce{MoS2} and \ce{WSe2} \cite{radisavljevic-2011, mak-2010}. 

Their electronic structure also changes markedly with thickness. Bulk TMDs have an indirect bandgap, whereas monolayers exhibit a direct bandgap associated with the two inequivalent and spin-polarized valleys located at the K and K$^{\prime}$ points of the Brillouin zone \cite{mak-2010,radisavljevic-2011}.

The reduced dielectric screening and strong quantum confinement in monolayer TMDs enhance the Coulomb interaction \cite{velicky-2017}, so that excitons dominate their optical properties at low temperature \cite{ugeda-2014}.
 Monolayer TMDs host tightly bound excitons with large oscillator strength, making them suitable for quantum photonics and integrated optoelectronics. Their small Bohr radius and weak dielectric screening make excitons highly sensitive to local perturbations, so that defects, strain, or dielectric disorder can easily confine excitons \cite{liang-2021}. Single-photon emission from such defect-bound excitons has been observed in monolayer TMDs, including \ce{WSe2} \cite{tonndorf-2015} and vacancy-engineered \ce{MoS2}, where sulfur vacancies created by electron or ion irradiation, as well as by thermal annealing, act as deep confinement centers \cite{mitterreiter-2021}.

%In \ce{WS2}, our previous work on non-encapsulated monolayers integrated onto SiC micro-heater chips showed that high-temperature annealing above 1000~K produces a new emission band, $X_\mathrm{L}$, located $\sim$220~meV below the neutral exciton with a linewidth of $\sim$12~meV.\,This emission saturates with excitation power and was attributed to excitons trapped at thermally generated sulfur vacancies. Nevertheless, the optical quality of non-encapsulated samples was limited by broad linewidths, photo-doping, and poor reproducibility, which prevented a clear demonstration of single-photon emission. Encapsulation in hBN is now established as a key strategy to obtain intrinsically narrow exciton and trion lines in TMD monolayers. The atomically flat and chemically inert hBN environment screens charge fluctuations, suppresses surface adsorbates, and protects the monolayer during high-temperature treatments. In encapsulated \ce{WS2}, low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra exhibit linewidths of only a few meV and well-resolved higher-lying excitonic resonances, providing an ideal platform to reveal weak defect-related features. 

In this work, we use controlled thermal annealing as a means to generate defects in monolayer \ce{WS2}. We fabricate hBN/\ce{WS2}/hBN heterostructures on the suspended SiC membrane of a commercial micro-heater chip. The micro-heater is then integrated in a cryostat, allowing local Joule heating of the membrane up to $\sim$1200~K while the surrounding environment is kept at a few kelvin. We demonstrate that controlled thermal annealing enables the formation of single quantum emitters in monolayer \ce{WS2}. The resulting single-photon emission arises from excitons localized at defect sites generated during the annealing process.

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{hBN-encapsulated WS$_2$ on micro-heater membranes}

Fully encapsulated \ce{WS2} monolayers were prepared by mechanical exfoliation of bulk crystals and assembly of hBN/\ce{WS2}/hBN heterostructures on \ce{Si/SiO2} substrates. The stack was then picked up using a PC stamp and transferred onto the suspended SiC membrane of a Protochips micro-heater as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}(a) with thermal release at $\sim 200^{\circ}$C. Figure \ref{fig:fig1}(b) shows the hBN encapsulated monolayer $WS_2$ on SiC membrane.

Figure \ref{fig:fig1}(c) represents the low temperature PL spectrum of the encapsulated \ce{WS2}, showing sharp excitonic resonances, including the neutral exciton $X^0$, negatively charged trions, dark-exciton related features, and phonon replicas with linewidths of only a few meV \cite{zinkiewicz-2021b}. The observation of complex excitonic species and biexcitons confirms the excellent optical quality of the samples and the effectiveness of encapsulation in suppressing dielectric disorder.

Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy, in which the detection energy is fixed while the excitation energy is scanned, probes the absorption pathways that populate a given emission line. An increase in PL intensity indicates that the excitation is resonant with an excitonic transition, allowing PLE to map the absorption spectrum linked to that state. Our PLE data in Figure \ref{fig:fig1}(d) reveals clear resonances at the A and B excitons and at the 2s excited states of the A exciton and the trion. The agreement between PL and PLE spectra shows that the excitonic structure is preserved after transfer and provides a reference for identifying new features that arise after annealing.

\subsection{Thermal annealing and emergence of the localized exciton $X_\mathrm{L}$}

Thermal annealing was performed \textit{in situ} by driving a dc current through the suspended SiC membrane inside a closed-cycle cryostat. For each annealing step the current was increased to reach a target temperature, held for typically 30~min, and then turned off, after which the membrane cooled back to the base temperature of a few kelvin. For the temperature calibration, we measured PL spectrum at each annealing temperature as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig2}(a) and compared position of the neutral exciton peak using Pässler's model for the bandgap renormalization \cite{nagler-2018a}, which allowed us to extend the calibration up to $\sim$900~K by extrapolating to higher temperatures.

Up to $\sim$1000~K the PL spectra remain dominated by the intrinsic excitonic features, apart from small reversible energy shifts and intensity changes. After annealing around 1100~K, an ultra sharp emission appears on the low-energy side of $X^0$. Figure \ref{fig:fig2}(b,c) show the emergence of narrow emissions. The emission line $X_\mathrm{L}$ located about 80~meV below the neutral exciton. 

In contrast to the few meV linewidths of the other excitonic peaks observed in as-exfoliated sample, $X_\mathrm{L}$ in encapsulated samples exhibits a linewidth below 0.2~meV at low excitation power, limited by the spectrometer resolution.

  \label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Excitonic origin and radiative dynamics of $X_\mathrm{L}$}

To identify the excitation pathway of $X_\mathrm{L}$, we perform PLE spectroscopy only for the emission at the $X_\mathrm{L}$ energy while scanning the laser energy across the excitonic resonances. The PLE spectrum in Figure \ref{3}(a) closely follows the absorption profile of the monolayer $WS_2$: it shows pronounced peaks at the A and B exciton energies and higher-lying states, mirroring the PLE recorded by as-exfoliated $WS_2$ (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}(d)). This one-to-one correspondence demonstrates that $X_\mathrm{L}$ is populated by excitons created in the \ce{WS2} bands rather than by extrinsic states in the substrate or encapsulation layers.

In addition, power-dependent PL measurements in Figure \ref{fig:fig3}(b) confirm the defect nature of $X_\mathrm{L}$. The integrated intensity initially increases linearly with excitation power and then saturates, as expected for a small number of defect sites that can host at most one exciton at a time. The linewidth of $X_\mathrm{L}$ broadens only weakly with power, which indicates that charge noise and local heating remain limited in the encapsulated structure.

Figure \ref{fig:fig3}(c) shows time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements. It indicates that the $X_\mathrm{L}$ emission decays with a characteristic lifetime of $\sim$0.9~ns. This lifetime is significantly longer than that of trion emission in the same sample, consistent with strong spatial localization suppressing nonradiative channels. The absence of a fast nonradiative component in the decay indicates that the defect potential defines a long-lived and efficient radiative recombination pathway.

The quantum nature of $X_\mathrm{L}$ is probed through second-order photon correlation measurements using a Hanbury Brown--Twiss setup under pulsed excitation. The measured intensity correlation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ shows a clear antibunching dip at zero delay with $g^{(2)}(0)\approx 0.3$ Figure \ref{fig:fig3}(d), which unambiguously proves that $X_\mathrm{L}$ acts as a single-photon emitter. The moderate residual value of $g^{(2)}(0)$ is attributed to background emission and imperfect spectral filtering and can be further reduced by improving the collection optics and spectral selection.

%Overall, the combination of spectrally isolated, ultra-narrow emission, nanosecond radiative lifetime, and antibunched photon statistics demonstrates that high-temperature annealing of encapsulated \ce{WS2} generates defect-based single-photon emitters that can be probed with high spectral resolution.

\section{Conclusion}

We have demonstrated a controllable pathway to create single-photon emitters in hBN-encapsulated monolayer \ce{WS2} by \textit{in situ} high-temperature annealing on a micro-heater platform. The clean dielectric environment provided by hBN enables the emergence of an ultra-narrow localized exciton $X_\mathrm{L}$ located around 80~meV below the neutral exciton after annealing around 1100~K. $X_\mathrm{L}$ exhibits a resolution-limited linewidth below 0.2~meV, a radiative lifetime of $\sim$0.9~ns, and clear photon antibunching with $g^{(2)}(0)\approx 0.3$, confirming its single-photon character. PLE and TRPL measurements show that $X_\mathrm{L}$ originates from intrinsic excitons captured by thermally generated vacancy-like defects that form deep, highly localized potentials.
